# confusion_matrix
Takes a list of images to be tested (outputs from indexes and ratio processing with different values to identify burned areas) and calculates values for the confusion matrix and saves it to a .txt file (True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative, Overall accuracy, Omission error, Comission error).
Also creates an numpy array with location of True Positive, True Negative, False Positive and False Negative to get a spatial representation.
